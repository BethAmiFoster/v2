/*
 * - Will work on this soon. Triggered when a mismatch between DB and Discord occurs
 *   For instance, when a user deletes a role that the database has stored.
 * 
 * - Will be implemented so if Woomy fails to find a role, user, etc. with the ID stored in
 *   the database, database doctor is triggered. Will attempt to resolve the discrepancy, or reset
 *   to default
